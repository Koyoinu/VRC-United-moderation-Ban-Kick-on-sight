# This is a list of all the United Moderation staff there alts and there name takers

Main: The main accounts of the official United Moderation staff world moderators 

Alts: The alternate accounts of there mains

Name takers: The people that like to help the United Moderation staff in ratting out people

Worlds: Worlds under the United moderation group

BOS: Block on Sight


This list was created on 4/24/2023 and was updated 4/28/2023


the reason why this list was created is because the United Moderation staff are known to not like Curtain groups of vrchat like Fatality, Shadow fox den, shaderXR and so on they are also known to stalk people they dont like in other worlds and these people are apart of a bigger group called United moderation of VR while the concept is good it is maintained by power hungry indivisuals that also break vrchats guidelines of the udon moderation tool that you can find here

https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/udon-moderation-tool-guidelines

We are United freedoms of VR and we stand for the Creative Freedoms of the people of VR 

here are the list of reasons why these people should be blocked by you if you so choose to

If you are accociated wwith any group such as Fatality, shadow fox den, shaderXR and so on they will take you as there taget and abuse the Udon moderation tool against you

if you show any signs of disobediance against them they will be tempted to use the Udon moderation tool against you

This is a major problem for people that like flashy shaders/effects as well they will think your accociated with said groups from the first reason

# a note to United moderation
If you find this then you have no power the easyiest thing to do with your power tripping mentality is something you couldnt do is to block you and your alts you call it ban evastion its more like box evasion you never really had the power to ban anyone all you do is push your problems away rather then really shutting them out by blocking those you dont like.


# Interesting facts

1. if you are banned from the furhub discord you are also retroactively banned from the furry hideout discord <- under investigation (i believe that united moderation has rats as mods and admins in the server trying to overly moderate other servers)

2. United moderation have rats everywhere on vrc where they know the people they dont like hang out and they actively record them and stalk them

3. United moderation dose not go off of pure evidence they go based off of feeling meaning if they suspect you of being in a gang being a person they dont like they will put in a box in a world they have access to the pannel 

4. In FBT the admins and mods hide outside the map
