**This list was created on 4/24/2023 and was updated 5/4/2023**

the reason why this list was created is because the United Moderation staff are known to not like Curtain groups of vrchat like Fatality, Shadow fox den, shaderXR and so on they are also known to stalk people they dont like in other worlds and these people are apart of a bigger group called United moderation of VR while the concept is good it is maintained by power hungry indivisuals that also break vrchats guidelines of the udon moderation tool that you can find here

[Udon Moderation Tool Guidelines](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/udon-moderation-tool-guidelines)
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85961107/235573883-534baa79-5ad5-4cce-a547-0aee5149e376.png)

We are United freedoms of VR and we stand for the Creative Freedoms of the people of VR 

here are the list of reasons why these people should be blocked by you if you so choose to

If you are accociated wwith any group such as Fatality, shadow fox den, shaderXR and so on they will take you as there taget and abuse the Udon moderation tool against you

if you show any signs of disobediance against them they will be tempted to use the Udon moderation tool against you

This is a major problem for people that like flashy shaders/effects as well they will think your accociated with said groups from the first reason

# **a note to United moderation**
- If you find this then you have no power the easyiest thing to do with your power tripping mentality is something you couldnt do is to block you and your alts you call it ban evastion its more like box evasion you never really had the power to ban anyone all you do is push your problems away rather then really shutting them out by blocking those you dont like.


# **Interesting facts**

1. United moderation have rats everywhere on vrc where they know the people they dont like hang out and they actively record them and stalk them

2. United moderation dose not go off of pure evidence they go based off of feeling meaning if they suspect you of being in a gang being a person they dont like they will put in a box in a world they have access to the pannel 

3. In FBT the admins and mods hide outside the map 

4. UM moderates places where there not welcome

5. Heshie one of UMs Freinds possible staff memebers uses crashers and UM turns a blind eye and lets it happen

6. you cant block UM staff but they can block you Meaning there histerically hypocritical in there own rules

7. UM is known for stalking mass reporting people they dont like this is why this list was made so that others can block them cause they really have no power if you block them its quite funny

# **News/Updates**

## 4/30/2023 9:25 PM CST
- a big thing is happening with furhub with the panle also Tau of the sun says he can see all worlds now witch is strange could this be possible client use by UM witch is i will remind you against VRchat TOS along with a massive Database that UM has or is making stay tuned to find out more News on UM and the active fight against Curated Moderation of VRchat
---
## 5/1/2023 2:35 PM CST
- According to Tau of the sun VRchat will be taking down The udon moderation guidelines but we all know its fualse information so that they can justify them getting away with stuff since vrchat has the guideliones link unlisted and you can only have access to it if you have a link its quite funny to see lies being spread to justify there actions they already turn a blind eye to crashers will they out right use crashers now? who knows

- Tau of the sun has reportedly said they can see all worlds now that is what they said in my mind i think he ment to say all instances even if they are private so is this him admiting to client use witch is breaking vrchats TOS i did cover this in yesterdays news i just wanted to break it down into something of what it could mean
---
## 5/3/2023 4:35 PM CST
- The Readme got a massive overhual
---
## 5/4/2023 7:00 PM CST
- The Udon moderation guidelines have not been Deleted Its cause VRchats knows if they did that it would create more Anarchy and someone attempted to report this Document to github for private information so i added more disclaimers for people as everything im doing is just looking stuff up and taking informatuion that i gather from my friends I made this document so people can block these people so that these people do not have any power to harass others 
---
# **Disclaimers**
- every bit of information gatherd is public information as these people have named there Twitter accounts the same as there Main vrchat accounts or they have it linked to there VRC profile that is how i got all this info **i do not plan to Dox the people in this document**

- Please do not harass anyone on this list just block them on VRchat on twitter what ever
